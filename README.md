# GDSerCommPlugin
A Godot plugin to read Arduino serial input

## It is heavily based and inspired by https://github.com/Superwaitsum/GDSercomm

# Notes
I have not added the shared libs for windows or mac.
Follow the instructions from Superwaitsum's repository and you should be able to add them yourself.

# Installation

* Git clone repo into your addons folder in the root of your project.
* Inside the editor got to Project->Projects Settings->Plugins and activate "Serial Communication"
